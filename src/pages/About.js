    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>
      Ars Technica was founded in 1998 when Founder & Editor-in-Chief Ken Fisher
      announced his plans for starting a publication devoted to technology that
      would cater to what he called "alpha geeks": technologists and IT
      professionals. Ken's vision was to build a publication with a simple
      editorial mission: be "technically savvy, up-to-date, and more fun" than
      what was currently popular in the space. In the ensuing years, with
      formidable contributions by a unique editorial staff, Ars Technica became
      a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, breakdowns of
      the latest scientific advancements, gadget reviews, software, hardware,
      and nearly everything else found in between layers of silicon. Ars
      Technica innovates by listening to its core readership. Readers have come
      to demand devotedness to accuracy and integrity, flanked by a willingness
      to leave each day's meaningless, click-bait fodder by the wayside. The
      result is something unique: the unparalleled marriage of breadth and depth
      in technology journalism. By 2001, Ars Technica was regularly producing
      news reports, op-eds, and the like, but the company stood out from the
      competition by regularly providing long thought-pieces and in-depth
      explainers
